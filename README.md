This react project is a culmination of everything I learned in both object oriented programming basics my intro to react course: The useState and useEffect hooks, 
making API calls with axios, and displaying react components dynamically. It gave me a small glimpse into what it might be like developing powerful 
official react applications. My favorite part of this project was in the planning. I had mapped out all the HTML that I thought was necessary in the first hour and a half. 
Surprisingly enough, I believe I invested the most time into the CSS. 

THINGS TO DO:

- Improve UI and Colours
- Add "Return to search" button on user page.
- TBD
