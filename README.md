This react project is a culmination of everything I learned in both my object oriented programming basics course and my intro to react course. I learned and built on concepts such as the useState and useEffect hooks, making API calls with axios, and displaying react components dynamically. It gave me a small glimpse into what it might be like developing powerful official react applications. My favorite part of this project was in the planning. I had mapped out all the HTML that I thought was necessary in the first hour and a half. Surprisingly enough, I believe I invested the most time into the CSS file(s). 

THINGS TO DO:

- Improve UI and Colours
- Add "Return to search" button on user page.
- TBD
