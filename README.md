This **react** project is a school project that encapsulates everything I learned in both my object oriented programming basics course and my intro to react course. I learned and built on concepts such as the **useState and useEffect hooks**, making API requests with **axios**, and displaying react components dynamically. It gave me a small glimpse into what it might be like developing vanilla react applications. My favorite part of this project was in the planning. I had mapped out all the **HTML** that I thought was necessary in the first hour and a half. Surprisingly enough, I believe I invested the most time in styling the project with **CSS**.

THINGS TO DO:

- Improve UI and Colours
- Add "Return to search" button on user page.
- TBD
